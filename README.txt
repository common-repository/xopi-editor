Easily edit posts and pages directly on your Wordpress front end with the XOpi&trade; Editor. Edit content, upload images and files, add links...

== Description ==

The XOpi&trade; Editor brings the Wordpress TinyMCE built-in editor to the front-end of your site or blog so that you can edit the content of your pages and posts while directly viewing them.

Simple installation and no modification of your themes or templates is required.

From the front-end admin toolbar just click the XOpi icon to toggle between editing and previewing your pages and posts so you can see exactly what your site is going to look like without visiting the back-end (you will need to log into the back-end to be able to edit with XOpi).
